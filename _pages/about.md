I'm a senior undergraduate student at [Pharmaceutical Science Program](https://med.cuhk.edu.cn/node/983), [School of Medicine](https://med.cuhk.edu.cn), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn). My research interests include chemical biology, bioanalytical chemistry, and epigenetics. 

Currently, I am working on bioimaging and immunotherapy fortunately under the guidance of [Prof. Zhaoting Li](https://med.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/976). The [Li lab](https://zhaotingli.com) is a group focusing on drug delivery and immunotherapy, but I am lucky to conduct bioanalytical research for my Final Year Project. 

In Fall 2025, I will join [Prof. Yinsheng Wang's lab](https://wanglab.ucr.edu) at [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu) as Chemistry Ph.D. student. I will continue to work on chemical biology, epigenetics, and bioanalytical chemistry.
