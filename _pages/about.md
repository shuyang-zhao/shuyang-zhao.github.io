I am an incoming Chemistry Ph.D. student in [Prof. Yinsheng Wang's lab](https://wanglab.ucr.edu) at [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu). My doctoral studies will focus on chemical biology, epitranscriptomics, and nucleic acid bioanalytical chemistry.  

I earned my BS at [Pharmaceutical Science Program](https://med.cuhk.edu.cn/node/983), [School of Medicine](https://med.cuhk.edu.cn), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn). During my undergraduate study, I was trained in drug delivery, immunotherapy, organic chemistry, and analytical chemistry.  

Currently, I am working on genome editing fortunately under the guidance of [Prof. Chengqi Yi](https://www.yilab.org.cn) at Peking University. I have worked with [Prof. Zhaoting Li](https://zhaotingli.com), [Prof. Wing-Fu Lai](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/faculty/staff/11935/dr-wing-fu-lai), and [Dr. Mao Li](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/limao) during undergraduate research trainings. Thank you all for your kind and professional guidance.
